# ðŸ§¸ Toy Sales Forecasting Project
_Predicting tomorrowâ€™s toy trends, today!_

A fun yet data-driven journey to uncover sales patterns and forecast future demand for toys using machine learning.

# ðŸŽ¯ About This Project
Ever wondered how toy stores know when to stock up on teddy bears or fidget spinners?
This project dives into sales data, analyzes trends, and builds a predictive model to help businesses make smart stocking decisions.

# ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement
Toys are seasonal, and the wrong prediction could mean _empty shelves during Christmas_ or _dusty boxes no one wants._
The goal here was to use **data science to forecast sales so toy retailers can plan inventory** like a pro, **reducing overstock, preventing shortages, and maximizing profit.**

# âœ¨ Key Features
ðŸ“Š Data Exploration & Cleaning â€” ensuring clean, reliable datasets for accurate forecasting.

ðŸ“ˆ Trend Visualization â€” identifying monthly sales patterns, seasonal spikes, and best-selling products.

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Forecast Model â€” predicting sales for the next 3 months with data-driven precision.

ðŸ“¦ Business Insights â€” translating analysis into actionable strategies for smarter inventory planning and improved profitability.
